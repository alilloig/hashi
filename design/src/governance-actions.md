# Governance Actions

Governance actions are all defined by their own unique `Proposal<T>` type.
Proposals are used to adjust protocol parameters, pause or unpause operations,
or perform sensitive operations like package upgrades. Only members of the
current hashi committee are able to create proposals. Each proposal type will
have its own threshold which will need to be reached by a quorum of validators
voting in support of the proposal.

The following is the current set of available proposal types:

### `Upgrade`

Authorizes a package upgrade.

### `EnableVersion`

Re-enables a previously disabled package version, allowing it to be used by the
protocol again.

### `DisableVersion`

Disables a package version, preventing it from being used. The currently active
version cannot be disabled to avoid bricking the protocol.

### `UpdateConfig`

Updates a protocol configuration parameter by key. Supports any config
key-value pair (e.g. deposit fee, rate limits).
